Map of the Milky Way Galaxy
Welcome to the Map of the Milky Way Galaxy project! This repository contains tools and resources to visualize and explore the structure of our galaxy, the Milky Way, using astronomical data and computational techniques.

Overview
This project aims to create an interactive and informative map of the Milky Way galaxy, showcasing its spiral arms, star clusters, and other celestial features. It leverages publicly available astronomical datasets and visualization libraries to provide an accessible way for enthusiasts, researchers, and students to study the galaxy’s structure.
Features
Interactive Visualization: Explore a 2D/3D representation of the Milky Way with zoom and pan capabilities.
Astronomical Data: Integrates data from sources like Gaia, NASA, or other open astronomical catalogs.
Customizable Parameters: Adjust scale, color schemes, or object types (stars, nebulae, etc.) for tailored visualizations.
Educational Tool: Designed to help users learn about galactic structure and astrophysics.
